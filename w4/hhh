##You have your existing swarm setup
##If you don't have the setup follow our 01 & 02 task and then add 3 managers, 3 workers to your swarm environment






##Verify that all your nodes are actively available
docker node ls






##!!If you arenâ€™t still running the redis service from the rolling update tutorial
docker service create --replicas 3 --name redis-lab --update-delay 10s redis:4.0.14-alpine







##Verify how the swarm manager assigned the tasks to different nodes
docker service ps redis-lab







##drain a node that had a task assigned to it
docker node update --availability drain <task assigned worker node name>







##Inspect the node to check its availability
docker node inspect --pretty <task assigned worker node name>







##Verify the replica count
docker service ls








##how the swarm manager updated the task assignments for the redis-lab service
docker service ps redis







##return the drained node to an active state
docker node update --availability active <task assigned worker node name>








##Inspect the node to see the updated state
docker node inspect --pretty <task assigned worker node name>
